# Exploratory Data Analysis - Project 2

**Disclaimer**: we were not requested not to commit this to source control, and I do find it usefull keeping my files in GitHub. So there it is. The sources I commited are copy and pasted from my repository, there are few small differences due to both typos I corrected only on the submitted coursera Project page, or slight format readjustmet to better fit the code textbox.
